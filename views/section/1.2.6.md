# Example: Testing for Primality
This section describes two methods for checking the primality of an integer
n, one with order of growth Θ( n), and a “probabilistic” algorithm
with order of growth Θ(log n). The exercises at the end of this section
suggest programming projects based on these algorithms.

## Searching for divisors
Since ancient times, mathematicians have been fascinated by problems
concerning prime numbers, and many people have worked on the prob-
lem of determining ways to test if numbers are prime. One way to test
if a number is prime is to find the number’s divisors. e following pro-
gram finds the smallest integral divisor (greater than 1) of a given num-
ber n. It does this in a straightforward way, by testing n for divisibility
by successive integers starting with 2.

```clojure
(defn smallest-divisor [n]
  (find-divisor n 2))

(defn find-divisor [n test-divisor]
  (cond (> (square test-divisor) n) n
        (divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor
        :else (find-divisor n (+ test-divisor 1))))

(defn divides? [a b]
  (= (remainder b a) 0))
```

We can test whether a number is prime as follows: n is prime if and only
if n is its own smallest divisor.
(define (prime? n)
(= n (smallest-divisor n)))

The end test for find-divisor is based on the fact that if n is not prime it
must have a divisor less than or equal to $\sqrt n $. This means that the algorithm need only test divisors between $1$ and $\sqrt n $. Consequently, the number of steps required to identify n as prime will have order of growth $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt n) $

## The Fermat Test
The $ \mathcal{O}(log n) $ primality test is based on a result from number theory

<blockquote>
If n is a prime number and a is any positive integer less than n, then a raised to the n<sup>th</sup> power is congruent to a modulo n.
<cite>Fermat’s Little Theorem</cite></blockquote>

(Two numbers are said to be congruent modulo n if they both have the
same remainder when divided by n. e remainder of a number a when
divided by n is also referred to as the remainder of a modulo n, or simply
as a modulo n.)
If n is not prime, then, in general, most of the numbers a < n will
not satisfy the above relation. is leads to the following algorithm for
testing primality: Given a number n, pick a random number a < n and
compute the remainder of a n modulo n. If the result is not equal to a,
then n is certainly not prime. If it is a, then chances are good that n is
prime. Now pick another random number a and test it with the same
method. If it also satisfies the equation, then we can be even more con-
fident that n is prime. By trying more and more values of a, we can
increase our confidence in the result. is algorithm is known as the
Fermat test.
To implement the Fermat test, we need a procedure that computes
the of exponential a number modulo another number:

(define (expmod base exp m)
(cond ((= exp 0) 1)
((even? exp)
(remainder
(square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
m))
(else
(remainder
(* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
m))))

is is very similar to the fast-expt procedure of Section 1.2.4. It uses
successive squaring, so that the number of steps grows logarithmically
with the exponent. 46
e Fermat test is performed by choosing at random a number a be-
tween 1 and n −1 inclusive and checking whether the remainder modulo
n of the n th power of a is equal to a. e random number a is chosen us-
ing the procedure random , which we assume is included as a primitive
in Scheme. Random returns a nonnegative integer less than its integer
input. Hence, to obtain a random number between 1 and n − 1, we call
random with an input of n − 1 and add 1 to the result:

(define (fermat-test n)
(define (try-it a)
(= (expmod a n n) a))
(try-it (+ 1 (random (- n 1)))))
e following procedure runs the test a given number of times, as spec-
ified by a parameter. Its value is true if the test succeeds every time, and
false otherwise.
(define (fast-prime? n times)
(cond ((= times 0) true)
((fermat-test n) (fast-prime? n (- times 1)))
(else false)))

# Probabilistic Methods
e Fermat test differs in character from most familiar algorithms, in
which one computes an answer that is guaranteed to be correct. Here,
the answer obtained is only probably correct. More precisely, if n ever
fails the Fermat test, we can be certain that n is not prime. But the fact
that n passes the test, while an extremely strong indication, is still not
a guarantee that n is prime. What we would like to say is that for any
number n, if we perform the test enough times and find that n always
passes the test, then the probability of error in our primality test can be
made as small as we like.

Unfortunately, this assertion is not quite correct. ere do exist num-
bers that fool the Fermat test: numbers n that are not prime and yet have
the property that a n is congruent to a modulo n for all integers a < n.
Such numbers are extremely rare, so the Fermat test is quite reliable in
practice.

ere are variations of the Fermat test that cannot be fooled. In these
tests, as with the Fermat method, one tests the primality of an integer n
by choosing a random integer a < n and checking some condition that
depends upon n and a. (See Exercise 1.28 for an example of such a test.)
On the other hand, in contrast to the Fermat test, one can prove that,
for any n, the condition does not hold for most of the integers a < n
unless n is prime. us, if n passes the test for some random choice of
a, the chances are beer than even that n is prime. If n passes the test
for two random choices of a, the chances are beer than 3 out of 4 that
n is prime. By running the test with more and more randomly chosen
values of a we can make the probability of error as small as we like.

e existence of tests for which one can prove that the chance of
error becomes arbitrarily small has sparked interest in algorithms of this
type, which have come to be known as probabilistic algorithms . ere is
a great deal of research activity in this area, and probabilistic algorithms
have been fruitfully applied to many fields.
