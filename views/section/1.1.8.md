# Functions as Black-Box Abstractions
`sqrt` is our first example of a process defined by a set of
mutually defined functions. Notice that the definition of
sqrt-iter is recursive; that is, the function is defined in
terms of itself. The idea of being able to define a function
in terms of itself may be disturbing; it may seem unclear
how such a “circular” definition could make sense at all,
much less specify a well-defined process to be carried out
by a computer.

Observe that the problem of computing square roots
breaks up naturally into a number of subproblems: how
to tell whether a guess is good enough, how to improve
a guess, and so on. Each of these tasks is accomplished by a separate function.

The importance of this decomposition strategy is not simply
that one is dividing the program into parts, rather, it is crucial that each
function accomplishesan identifiable task that can be used as a module in
defining other functions.

For example, when we define the
`good-enough?` function in terms of square , we are able
to regard the square function as a “black box.” We are
not at that moment concerned with how the function
computes its result, only with the fact that it computes the
square. The details of how the square is computed can besuppressed, to be considered at a later time. Indeed, as far
as the `good-enough?` function is concerned, square is not
quite a function but rather an abstraction of a function,
a so-called procedural abstraction. At this level of abstraction, any function that computes the square is equally
good.

Thus, considering only the values they return, the following
two functions for squaring a number should be
indistinguishable. Each takes a numerical argument and
produces the square of that number as the value. 25

```clojure
(defn square [x]
  (* x x))
```

```clojure
(defn (square x)
  (exp (double (log x))))

(defn double [x]
   (+ x x))
```

So a function definition should be able to suppress detail.
The users of the function may not have written the
function themselves, but may have obtained it from another
programmer as a black box. A user should not need
to know how the function is implemented in order to use
it.

## Performance
It is not even clear which of these functions is a more efficient
implementation. This depends upon the hardware available.
There are machines for which the “obvious” implementation is
the less efficient one. Consider a machine that has extensive tables
of logarithms and antilogarithms stored in a very efficient
manner.

## Local Names
One detail of a function’s implementation that should
not matter to the user of the function is the implementer’s
choice of names for the function’s formal
parameters.

Thus, the following functions should not be
distinguishable:

```
(defn square [x]
   (* x x))
```

```
(defn square [y]
  (* y y))
```

This principle, that the meaning of a function should be
independent of the parameter names used by its author,
seems on the surface to be self-evident, but its consequences
are profound. The simplest consequence is that
the parameter names of a function must be local to the
body of the function. For example, we used square in the
definition of good-enough? in our square-root function:

```
(defn good-enough? [guess x]
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.001))
```

The intention of the author of good-enough? is to determine
if the square of the first argument is within a given
tolerance of the second argument. We see that the author
of good-enough? used the name guess to refer to the first
argument and x to refer to the second argument. The argument
of square is guess . If the author of square used
x (as above) to refer to that argument, we see that the x in
good-enough? must be a different x than the one in square .
Running the function square must not affect the value of x that is used by good-enough? , because that value of x may
be needed by good-enough? after square is done computing.

If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective
functions, then the parameter x in square could
be confused with the parameter x in good-enough? , and
the behavior of good-enough? would depend upon which
version of square we used. Thus, square would not be the
black box we desired.

A formal parameter of a function has a very special role
in the function definition, in that it doesn’t matter what
name the formal parameter has. Such a name is called a
*bound variable*, and we say that the function definition
binds its formal parameters. The meaning of a function
definition is unchanged if a bound variable is consistently
renamed throughout the definition.

If a variable is not bound, we say that it is *free*. The set of expressions for
which a binding defines a name is called the *scope* of that
name.

In a function definition, the bound variables declared
as the formal parameters of the function have the
body of the function as their scope.

In the definition of `good-enough?` above, `guess` and `x` are
bound variables but `<` , `-` , `abs` , and `square` are free. The
meaning of `good-enough?` should be independent of the
names we choose for `guess` and `x` so long as they are distinct
and different from `<` , `-` , `abs` , and `square` . (If we renamed
`guess` to `abs` we would have introduced a bug by
capturing the variable `abs` . It would have changed from
free to bound.)

The meaning of `good-enough?` is not independent
of the names of its free variables, however. It
surely depends upon the fact (external to this definition)
that the symbol `abs` names a function for computing the
absolute value of a number. Good-enough? will compute a
different function if we substitute cos for abs in its definition.

# TODO
maybe namespaces, block structure and lexical scoping?
