# Conditional Expressions
## `if`
If expressions have the form

```
(if <predicate>
    <consequent>
    <alternative>)
```

The `<alternative>` clause is optional, nil is returned if the
predicate is false and an alternative is not supplied.

```clojure
> (if (= (count "four")
         4)
      :predicate-was-true
      :predicate-was-false)
:predicate-was-true
```


```clojure
> (if (= (count "three")
         3)
      :no-consequent)
nil
```
## `cond`
`cond` expressions have the form

```clojure
(cond <predicate1>
      <consequence1>

      ...

      <predicate_n>
      <consequence_n>

      :else
      <catchall>
      )
```

The predicates are evaluated in turn and the first time one is
'truthy', its consequence is evaluated and returned. Calling `cond`
with an odd number of arguments will throw an error.

Here `:else` is just a normal symbol (hence is truthy)

```clojure
> (def x -12)

> (cond (> x 0)
        x

        (= x 0)
        0

        (< x 0)
        (- x))
12

> (cond (< 0 x)
        "Negative"
        :else
        "Positive")
"Negative"
```

## In scheme

If you are reading along with SICP note that Scheme uses list
structure to separate the clauses of cond and `else` is special.

Eg:

```scheme
(cond ((> x 0)
       x)
      ((= x 0)
       0)
      (else
       (- x)))
```
